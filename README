This is a somewhat functional compiler for CS445, the dragon project.  In it's current state it does type checking, symatic evaluation to the degree I understand and compiles to close but not quite correct intel32 asembly.  There are a few glaring issues outlined in the TODO file.

Make:
	running `make` builds bigd
	running `make test` builds bigd and compiles a sample program

Running bigd:
	bigd program.p [--tree]		the tree option will print out the syntax tree after the asm
